<b>Introduction</b>
Climate change is a global crisis, and accurate carbon emissions monitoring is essential for effective mitigation strategies. While many regions have sophisticated monitoring systems, Africa often lacks such infrastructure. This challenge aims to address this gap by performing deep data analysis developing machine learning models to predict carbon emissions using satellite data.

<b>Objective</b>
The goal of this challenge is to create a machine learning or deep learning model that can accurately predict carbon emissions in Africa based on open-source CO2 data from the Sentinel-5P satellite. These models will provide valuable insights for governments and researchers, enabling them to assess carbon emissions levels in areas where traditional monitoring is limited or unavailable.
