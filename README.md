<b>CO2 Emissions in Rwanda</b>

<b>Introduction</b>

Climate change is a global crisis, and accurate carbon emissions monitoring is essential for effective mitigation strategies. While many regions have sophisticated monitoring systems, Africa often lacks such infrastructure. This challenge aims to address this gap by performing deep data analysis developing machine learning models to predict carbon emissions using satellite data.

<b>Objective</b>

The goal of this notebook is to clean and analyse the dataset to find deep and unsual patterns in the dataset.
